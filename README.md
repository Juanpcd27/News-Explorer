* I created a News Explorer website that allows you to search from any news located in the News API that's being fetched.
  
* The news will be presented to the user in a card, displaying the searched news picture, title, description, date and time it was published and the source, the news will load in a set of 3 cards with an additional button to show more news.
  
* The user can register and log in with a sign up and sign in form, when logged in the user will be able to navigate to the saved articles section.

* This project is designed in a responsive way, meaning it can be accessed in any resolution.

* The project is deployed with Github Pages and you can find the link for deployment here: https://juanpcd27.github.io/final-project-JPCD-frontend/
